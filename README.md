## Starbucks Capstone Challenge

``Project Overview``


This project analyzes customer behavior on the Starbucks rewards mobile app. Starbucks frequently sends promotional offers to users, and the goal is to determine which demographic groups respond best to different types of offers. The analysis leverages machine learning techniques to predict user behavior and optimize promotional strategies.

``Dataset``

The dataset consists of three JSON files:

**portfolio.json**: Contains details of promotional offers such as type, duration, reward, and distribution channels.

**profile.json**: Contains customer demographic data including age, gender, income, and membership details.

**transcript.json**: Contains event logs tracking user interactions with offers, including when they were received, viewed, or completed.
